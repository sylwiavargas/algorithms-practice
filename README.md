### So you graduated from a bootcamp - now what?
# ALGORITHMS!

Every day, I commit to deepen my knowledge of algorithms and data structures.

### Resources:
* Course: https://www.udemy.com/coding-interview-bootcamp-algorithms-and-data-structure/ by Stephen Grider https://github.com/StephenGrider
* Book: Grokking Algorithms
* Book: Cracking Coding Interview

### Random notes:

Using debugger in the terminal:
1. insert debugger + call the function in your file
2. cd to the directory
3. node inspect index.js
4. c to continue
5. repl to enter the console
6. "exit" to exit repl & you can move onto the next debugger (or the same in the next run of the for loop eg.) by pressing c;
7. to exit completely: ctrl + c;
8. remember to remove the debugger and the function call!

-----------------------------------------
.every()

-> checks whether every element of an array passes the test implemented by the provided function, e.g. a function that checks whether all elements are greater than five would look like this:

arr.every((v) => v > 5)
